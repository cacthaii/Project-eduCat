Welcome to the educat app!
**************************
Excuse the terrible cat puns, it was meant to be a play on the word "educate"!
More importantly, the app functions as a site that aims to provide revision on the specified topics
through multiple choice and single answer questions in a quiz-like style, ranging from 3 available 
difficulties: easy, medium, hard.

**************************************************************************************************************
The homepage contains links to all other pages, with a small welcome message.

The about link takes the user to a page displaying all available modules, listed, and as links that then 
display all of that module's available questions while also telling them what difficulty they are.
The user can then choose which question they'll try, after every successful answer they will advance 
through all the questions in the module, after which they'll be notified they have succesfully completed the 
module!

Our second link the find link takes te user to a search page, where they can pick from the dropdowns
and specifically look for the questions within the selected range.

Lastly, the Gauntlet serves as a fun "mode" where the user can enter their name, and have a go at 
doing all the questions in one go. 
At any point of failure a "game-over" screen is displayed with the user's score; upon success a
congratulatory screen is presented to the user.

**************************************************************************************************************
Please enjoy the app, and see if you can complete the gauntlet yourself!
